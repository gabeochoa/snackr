# snackr

Have you ever wanted to keep track of what goes in and out of your fridge and
pantry? Snackr will keep track of it all for you so food won't get forgotten
or spoiled, especially if your fridge is full or shared with friends.

Snackr requires a grocery store to output a QR code on the customer receipt
representing the information about the items purchased.
Using a QR scanner, a client can use our web app to update a live inventory of
their digital pantry online, see what they have left (instead of digging
through the freezer), and update what they've eaten.
